    //Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool
    // A thread pool is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready to handle a task.
    // When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the threads in the pool to the task, 
    // and that thread will process the task. The remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks
    // that come in while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done processing its task,
    // itâ€™s returned to the pool of idle threads, 
    // ready to handle a new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently, 
    // increasing the throughput of your server.
